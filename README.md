# Plagiarism-Check-and-AI-Authorship-Check-for-English
 am seeking a skilled native or native level English professional to review my document and ensure it is entirely plagiarism-free. Additionally, it is crucial that the AI-written score is reduced to zero. The candidate should have experience with plagiarism detection tools and a keen eye for originality. If you have a strong background in content writing, editing, or academic integrity, I would love to hear from you. Please provide examples of previous work related to document editing for plagiarism.
=======================
Here’s a Python script using popular tools and libraries to help analyze and ensure plagiarism-free content, focusing on reducing AI-written scores. This is a semi-automated approach that checks for plagiarism and provides a basis for editing content.

You can integrate this script into a larger framework or use it as a standalone tool.
Python Script: Plagiarism Detection and Content Adjustment

import requests
from transformers import pipeline
import re

# Function to check plagiarism using an external API
def check_plagiarism(content):
    # Replace with actual plagiarism-checking service endpoint and API key
    api_url = "https://api.plagiarism-checker.com/analyze"
    api_key = "your_api_key_here"

    payload = {"text": content}
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"}

    try:
        response = requests.post(api_url, json=payload, headers=headers)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            data = response.json()
            print(f"Plagiarism Score: {data['plagiarism_score']}%")
            return data
        else:
            print("Error in plagiarism check:", response.text)
            return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to check plagiarism: {e}")
        return None

# Function to reduce AI-written scores (simple paraphrasing example)
def reduce_ai_written_score(content):
    # Using HuggingFace's transformers for paraphrasing
    paraphrase_pipeline = pipeline("text2text-generation", model="t5-small")

    print("\nOriginal Content:")
    print(content)
    
    try:
        paraphrased = paraphrase_pipeline(f"Paraphrase: {content}", max_length=512, truncation=True)
        reduced_content = paraphrased[0]['generated_text']
        print("\nParaphrased Content:")
        print(reduced_content)
        return reduced_content
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error in paraphrasing: {e}")
        return content

# Function to clean and preprocess content
def clean_content(content):
    # Removing extra whitespace, unnecessary characters, etc.
    content = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', content)
    content = re.sub(r'[^\x00-\x7F]+', ' ', content)  # Remove non-ASCII characters
    return content.strip()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Input content to analyze
    input_content = """
    Paste your content here. Ensure this is the text to be checked for plagiarism and AI-written characteristics.
    """

    # Step 1: Clean content
    clean_text = clean_content(input_content)
    
    # Step 2: Check for plagiarism
    plagiarism_results = check_plagiarism(clean_text)

    # Step 3: Reduce AI-written scores
    revised_content = reduce_ai_written_score(clean_text)

    # Optional: Save results to a file for record-keeping
    with open("revised_document.txt", "w") as file:
        file.write(revised_content)
    print("\nRevised content saved to 'revised_document.txt'.")

Key Features:

    Plagiarism Check:
        Utilizes an API for plagiarism analysis (replace with your API details).
        Prints the plagiarism score.

    Paraphrasing:
        Reduces AI-written scores by using Hugging Face’s T5 model for paraphrasing.
        Outputs both the original and paraphrased content.

    Content Cleaning:
        Removes unnecessary characters and whitespace for cleaner processing.

    File Handling:
        Saves the revised document as revised_document.txt.

Requirements:

    Install required Python packages:

    pip install requests transformers

    Set up an API key for a plagiarism checker, such as Copyleaks or Grammarly (replace api_url and api_key placeholders).

    Use this script to analyze and revise the content for plagiarism and AI-written characteristics.

Notes:

    Manual Review: The script provides automation but may require manual adjustments to ensure the final document meets quality and originality requirements.
    Paraphrasing Models: Use larger models like t5-large for higher quality results (ensure adequate computational resources).
    Ethics: Always verify usage of AI for permissible and ethical practices in content writing.
